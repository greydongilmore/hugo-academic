    "Data pre-processing techniques generally refer to the addition, deletion, or transformation of training set data. Different models have different sensitivities to the type of predictors in the model; *how* the predictors enter the model is also important. Transformations of the data to reduce the impact of data skewness or outliers can lead to significant improvements in performance. \n",
